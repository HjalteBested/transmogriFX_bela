## Bela Multi-FX Project Code

Easiest way to run this on Bela is clone this repository.

Go to IDE -> Create new project

Name it whatever you want

Upload all of the source files (all_files_ending_with.h and all_files_ending_with.cpp, and optionally the .json file)

Then add all of these files from your local (cloned) repo.

When you update, delete all the files in your Bela project and upload all from your local (updated) repo again.

There are more elegant ways to do this, but if you're experienced enough to do it more elegantly then you don't need this README to tell you what to do.
